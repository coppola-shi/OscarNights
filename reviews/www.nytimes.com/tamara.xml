      <text> You would think by now that mean girls and alpha males would have figured out that no good can ever come from picking on the weird chick, especially if she's in the habit of tacking spooky drawings in her locker and shuffling tarot cards on lunch break. Having failed to learn the lessons of history, bullies are doomed to repeat their mistakes: they will inevitably inflict one too many humiliations on the homely girl, triggering a full-scale makeover and sassy supernatural backlash. Next time, they would do well to study "Carrie" and dip into "Clueless." Having done so, they can cut class on "Tamara" day.  A low-budget horror film with even lower ambitions, "Tamara" is a movie of few innovations but one genuine, if unintentional, surprise. The titular role is filled, in a red bustier, by Jenna Dewan, who plays a wallflower squashed in a prank gone wrong, only to be resurrected as a sorceress of great evil and total foxiness. Tamara is more or less credible as she metes out revenge, enchanting former classmates so they will enact her nefarious whims, but she comes up short in her character's most crucial aspect: the ability to storm down hallways in high heels. I feared more for her equilibrium than for her victims. Of all the terrible things they are compelled  to do to themselves — slice off ears, gnaw off fingertips, chew on glass — the one act deemed so gruesome by the filmmakers that it can't be shown in the same gory detail as the rest is a bit of hypnosis-induced lovemaking between two straight dudes. The horror!  "Tamara" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The movie has gore, cussing, underage drinking and ill-fitting, skimpy outfits.</text>
