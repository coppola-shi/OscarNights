      <text> “CSNY: Déjà Vu,” Neil Young’s film about a Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young concert tour in 2006, has some delicious moments, but  you never quite shake the feeling  that it’s documenting a tempest in a teapot.  The band was responsible for some of rock’s most confrontational songs in the Vietnam era, including “Ohio,” about the Kent State shootings in 1970, and two years ago Mr. Young (who directs here under his whimsical alias, Bernard Shakey) went back on the road with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and David Crosby with some new tunes about Iraq.  The film tries to play up the mixed reaction engendered by songs like “Let’s Impeach the President,” and there is one interesting scene of people walking out of a concert in Atlanta because of the show’s political tone. But mostly the movie feels like manufactured controversy. In trying to draw parallels to the atmosphere of the 1960s and ’70s it only underscores just how long ago it was that music had the power to shape and focus the public debate.  So that leaves this a film you watch for the small moments. The man-on-the-street comments captured by Mr. Young and Mike Cerre, a journalist who joined the project, are priceless Americana. And one juxtaposition — the band performs the anthem “For What It’s Worth,” then the film cuts to a nutty appearance by Mr. Young on “The Colbert Report” — is particularly sweet.  “CSNY: Déjà Vu” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has some strong language and brief war images.</text>
