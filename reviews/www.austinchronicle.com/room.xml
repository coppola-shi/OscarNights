      <text>Last month�s Chronicle
 cover featuring the latest wave of Austin filmmakers limited itself to those with movies playing at SXSW, but any truly representative roll call of Austin�s newest generation would put Kyle Henry front and center. In fact, he�s been around a while � as a film programmer, a documentarian (American Cowboy, University Inc.)
, and an editor (Manito)
. But Room
, which played at Cannes and Sundance last year and netted two Independent Spirit Awards nominations this year, marks new territory for Henry: his narrative feature debut. �Narrative� might be a misleading term, however, as Room
 bucks conventional storytelling models. The title, the tidiest thing about Room
, refers to the site-specific hallucinations of a Houston-based woman named Julia (Williams). Already buckling under the strain of two jobs, a stressful home life, and debilitating migraines, Julia can now add �visions� to her laundry list of ailments. At the supermarket, in the living room � wherever, it seems � her perspective starts to go staticky, as if her reception�s going out, and she becomes bombarded by scattershot images of a warehouse-type room until she finally blacks out. When one of these episodes results in a car crash outside Houston�s George Bush International Airport (which may or may not be a sign), Julia flees her family for New York, on a sort of vision quest to decode just what the hell�s going on up in her alarmingly addled head. That quest takes her to odd places, like a meditation group and a tarot card reader. Julia spins on a dime if she senses something is a sign, and one of the haunting poignancies of the film is how hungry she, and we, are for anything remotely resembling a sign. And they�re seemingly everywhere, especially in the white noise of traffic reports and graffiti art and news dispatches from Iraq that blankets the film. (Note to self: If one suffers from sensitivity to the blaring pop-culture parade, then New York, and especially Times Square, may not be the smartest place to sojourn.) Justin Hennard and Chris Keyland�s sound design � dense, jittery, and spectacularly creepy � is one of the chief pleasures of the piece, and that soundscape, working in concert with PJ Raval�s terrific camerawork, create a constant, ever-upticking state of anxiety. There�s no rest for the weary � or the panic-attack-prone � here, and if you need further convincing, it�s scrawled all over Williams� face. Dominating nearly every frame and communicating largely through her body language (watch her walk � it�s a revelation), Williams delivers an astonishing, open-faced performance, one that demands sympathy while steadfastly refusing accessibility. That inaccessibility � at least in broad strokes � extends to the whole film, which wears the skin of a psychological thriller, but plays out as something far darker, weirder, and more distancing. It�s easy to call Room
 an avant-garde film, but I think more significantly it�s an American
 film, in its paranoia and confusion, cultural branding and search for solace, and in a whole host of other ways I haven�t yet � and maybe never will � unpack. Near the end of the film, as Julia�s hallucinations grow more frenzied, I made a note: �There better be a big fucking payoff.� Guess what? There isn�t one. But that note � borne equally out of frustrated genre expectations and nerves nearly frayed by the film�s expert ratcheting of tension � speaks to Henry�s ability to burrow in and, well, frankly, to bother. For a film about looking for a sign, looking for solace, Room
 quite brazenly offers neither. It isn�t an easy film, but the world�s already got plenty of easy and easily digestible films. Nervy and confounding pictures, however, we could use more of. See
