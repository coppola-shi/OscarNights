      <text>War movie, horror movie&#151;the difference is negligible in the grim sequel to last year's hit remake of Wes Craven 's 1977 mutant thriller. After a grisly childbirth and some gory killings, the real action starts with a group of gung-ho National Guardsmen blasting their way through Kandahar . It proves to be a training exercise in the Southwestern desert, thank God, but the troops are being watched by a real menace: the man- eating spawn of 1950s nuclear testing, who have learned a few things about strategery as they lure the soldiers into a killing ground of rocky hiding places and booby-trapped tunnels. Yes, the most assured fighting men are the first to go; yes, the company peacenik (Michael McMillian ) will undergo a Straw Dogs  conversion to lethal force. Directed by Martin Weisz  from a script by Craven and his son Jonathan, the movie has already bummed out the fanboys with its paucity of cool kills&#151;this despite a genuinely unnerving who's-out-there use of shallow focus and a mortality rate in the high double digits. But for anyone other than hardcore gore-hounds, this flipbook of deliberately invoked global-unrest horrors, from friendly-fire killings to rape as a breeding weapon, is effectively mean and unrelenting&#151;and pretty far from fun.
