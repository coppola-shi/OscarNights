The teaming of action stars Jet Li and Jason Statham may raise audience expectations for a lean, mean ass-kicking machine, but �War� turns out to be a flabby and formulaic programmer. Early scenes appear to promise a clever commingling of elements from Dashiell Hammett�s �Red Harvest� (by way of Akira Kurosawa�s �Yojimbo�) and Michael Cimino�s disreputably rousing �Year of the Dragon.� But pic quickly devolves into a standard-issue crime drama laced with routine martial artistry. What is �War� good for? A $10 million opening weekend, to be followed by an extended slog through homevid and cable streams.
Statham stars as John Crawford, a terse, tough FBI agent who bulldozes his way through a San Francisco turf war between yakuza and triad forces. Crawford claims he doesn�t much care if the Chinese gang, led by smooth-talking Chang (John Lone), and the Japanese clan, controlled by tradition-bound Shiro (Ryo Ishibashi), destroy each other. Somewhere amid the combatants, however, Crawford hopes to locate the infamous assassin who killed his partner and the poor guy�s wife and child three years earlier.
The most likely suspect: Victor Shaw (Jet Li), aka Rogue, a stealthy and taciturn hitman who uses a variety of weaponry -- everything from a high-powered rifle to a bomb-laden Doberman -- to dispatch his victims. (If a potential victim runs away from a swordfight, Shaw simply takes out his pistol and perforates the fleeing flunky.) When he isn�t busy earning the trust of rival crime bosses, he�s pitting their minions against each other with a lie here, a frame-up there and dead bodies everywhere. 
Not surprisingly, Crawford takes a special interest in Shaw, and vice versa. As it turns out, though, each man has a nasty surprise in store for the other.
Scripters Lee Anthony Smith and Gregory J. Bradley deserve credit for a genuinely ingenious twist in the final reel and criticism for the rest of their muddled and meandering scenario. Musicvid vet Philip G. Atwell (who also handled second unit chores for �National Treasure�) brings ample visual pizzazz but minimal narrative drive to his debut effort as a feature helmer. Indeed, even with the aid of ace lenser Pierre Morel (who directed the rather more dynamic �District B13�) and legendary fight choreographer Cory Yuen, Atwell can�t elevate his fight scenes above the level of rough-and-tumble stuff common to made-for-homevid B-pics.
In terms of sheer physicality, Statham is an undeniably strong screen presence. But he pushes his luck here by delivering all his dialogue in the same raspy whisper, a sandpapered tone that suggests the actor spent all his time between takes shouting at the top of his lungs and chain-smoking unfiltered cigarettes. Li, too, makes all the right moves, gliding through the proceedings with the serene self-confidence of someone who�s already the read the script and knows how things turn out. Dialogue isn�t a problem: He has, at most, maybe 25 lines in the entire pic.
Among the supporting players, Lone does first-rate work in a two-dimensional role, though his appearance here, 20 years after what seemed like a star-making performance in �The Last Emperor,� may be cause for melancholy among some admirers. On the plus side, at least he gets more to do than a couple other familiar figures -- Luis Guzman as a street-smart Interpol agent, Saul Rubinek as a hard-drinking plastic surgeon -- in even sketchier parts.
