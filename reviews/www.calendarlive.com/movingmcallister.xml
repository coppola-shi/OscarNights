 Move away from 'McAllister'
The madcap factor is off the charts in "Moving McAllister," a rather anemic road movie written by and starring Ben Gourley, who made the big mistake of building into his situation comedy clocks and maps -- factors that keep reminding us how long it is till the end of the film.
 
 Gourley is personable enough as law intern Rick Robinson, who is asked by his imperious boss (Rutger Hauer) to transport his beautiful, spoiled and free-spirited niece, Michelle (Mila Kunis) from Georgia to Malibu -- and do it in the four days before Rick's bar exam.
 
 You kind of expect everything to go wrong, and it does, and you're not surprised. Kunis ("That '70s Show") lights up the screen, and Jon Heder ("Napoleon Dynamite") delivers another in what will one day be a large collection of stoner roles. There are enough reasons to avoid this oh-so-wacky comedy as it meanders from piney Georgia to Port Arthur, Texas, to Monument Valley, Utah, and they include Gourley's sense of direction. Directed by Andrew Black.
