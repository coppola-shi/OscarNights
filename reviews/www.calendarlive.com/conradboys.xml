      <text>         Writer-director-editor Justin Lo's "The Conrad Boys" reveals little cinematic instinct or imagination but has a deeply personal quality that becomes engaging.
 
 Initially self-conscious and not always plausible, the film, which plays like a student effort, centers on two brothers, Charlie (Lo) and his considerably younger sibling Ben (Boo Boo Stewart). Charlie undertakes the responsibility of raising Ben.
 


         






    How Charlie hopes to hold on to and keep up a reasonably upscale Newport Beach home on a waiter's salary is unclear. In any event, Charlie's life quickly becomes even more stressful. A handsome, charismatic drifter, Jordan (Nick Bartzen), seduces Charlie and moves in, which leaves Charlie feeling vulnerable to a guy who could spell big trouble. Meanwhile, Charlie and Ben's absent father (Barry Shay) turns up, a recovering alcoholic eager to win over Ben if not Charlie, who has long felt embittered.
 
 Lo has written substantial roles for Bartzen and Shay, but Lo himself is a little flat. He might be better off staying behind the camera and concentrating on developing his writing and directing skills. Refreshingly, Charlie's homosexuality is presented as a nonissue, and his Eurasian heritage is also handled matter-of-factly. "The Conrad Boys" has moments that play well, but it remains to be seen whether Lo has what it takes to be a successful filmmaker.
